# Split One-Pager
We were tasked with creating a small one-pager for an imaginary hair salon called Split Studio.

## The Product
We chose to create a website for a hairsalon mainly because we figured it would be easy to find good-looking material online.
But also because we felt it was more interesting aesthetically to work with images of people rather than inanimate objects.

## Design
The design is very clean and minimalistic in an attempt to steal as little attention away from the showcase images as possible, and we felt a less "commercial"-look and more editorial would feel more exclusive. As it is a very high-end salon. So we used the dividing line in the middle to create the feel of a magazine. Such fashion.

â€¢ Font
We went with two fonts that worked well together and had the right feel.
For our display font we chose Circular paired with MrsEaves for the articles.

## Wireframing
Early in the project we did some quick pen-and-paper sketches to get a feel for the form.
The final split-view of our site is an element that stuck with us since day 1!
Then we created mockups in figma.

## Final Thoughts
The most challenging aspect was to balance the look we were going for (minimalistic, exclusive) and having enough information present to the user. Had we continued with this project we would run tests to see if the navigation is clear or if there is some info they would like to be able to see.
